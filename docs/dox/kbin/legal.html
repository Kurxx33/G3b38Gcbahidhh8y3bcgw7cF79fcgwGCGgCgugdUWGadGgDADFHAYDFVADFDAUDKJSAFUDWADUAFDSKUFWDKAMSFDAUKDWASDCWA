                kBin is completely legal so long as you are <u>not</u> obtaining this information <u>illegally</u>, whether that be via 'hacking' computer systems to obtain it, or stealing it in person. (Can anybody prove it? Not unless you brag about it)<br>
                It is your sole responsibility to manage and uphold your online anonymity. You are not intuitively guaranteed the right to be anonymous.<br>
                <br>
                Though we do try our hardest to limit/mitigate the amount of spam and pastes that break our tos, it is near impossible. Any paste that <u>does</u> break our TOS please report them.<br>
                <br>
                <p>kBin was not made for harassment, intimidation or to cause nuisance.</p>
                <p>It is simply a 3rd party supplied Whitepages and Guns.lol alternative.</p>
                <p>It is impossible for some php code to harass somebody.</p>
                <p>Every paste made on this website is considered sole property of the person who uploaded it, not the site.</p>

                <p>Any pastes directly threatening and/or attempt to injure or hurt any particular individuals will be swiftly removed.</p>
                <p>If the paste does not contain direct threats, this does not apply.</p>
                <br>    
                <p>We, the operators of kBin, are provided immunity from all legal action held against anything uploaded to kBin.</p>

                <p>Section 230(c)(1) provides immunity from liability for providers and users of an "interactive computer service" who publish information provided by third-party users:</p>
                <p>- No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.</p>
                <p>The CDA applies to malicious doxing by creating a liability shield for us here at Doxbin and thus removing a potential pathway to being busted.</p>

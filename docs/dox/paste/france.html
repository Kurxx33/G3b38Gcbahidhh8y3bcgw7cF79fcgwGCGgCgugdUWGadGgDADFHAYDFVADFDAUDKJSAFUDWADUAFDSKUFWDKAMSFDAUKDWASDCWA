The French government’s decision to arrest Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, is not only a desperate overreach but also a violation of fundamental rights.
By targeting Durov, French authorities are attempting to pin the blame for the actions of a few bad actors on a platform that has, in fact, adhered to international laws.
Telegram is legally compliant and has cooperated with global governments on issues ranging from counterterrorism to cybercrime.
Arresting the platform's founder under the guise of stopping illegal activities only highlights the government’s failure to address the root problems within its own system, 
rather than acknowledging Telegram's efforts to ensure that its platform remains a space for freedom of speech and lawful discourse.

This move by the French government sets a dangerous precedent for digital freedom. Durov is being unjustly punished for a platform he built 
that promotes privacy and communication, values that are protected under international law. 
Telegram has clear terms of service and policies in place that prohibit illegal activities, and holding Durov personally accountable for content generated by millions of users is both unreasonable and legally indefensible. 
Instead of working constructively to address these issues, the French government has chosen to arrest a tech innovator, effectively sending a message that they would rather scapegoat individuals than confront their own regulatory shortcomings.
